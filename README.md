# SoloShop - Django + React Project

SoloShop is a full-stack web application built using Django on the backend and React on the frontend. It provides a platform for managing products, user accounts, orders, and more. This README file will give you an overview of the project's structure and functionality.

## Django URL Patterns

In the Django backend, the URL patterns are defined as follows:

- `/admin/`: The Django admin panel.
- `/`: The main page of the SoloShop application.
- `/api/products/`: API endpoints for managing products.
- `/api/users/`: API endpoints for user-related operations.
- `/api/orders/`: API endpoints for managing orders.

These URL patterns handle the backend logic of the SoloShop project.

## React Routes

In the React frontend, the application is structured using React Router, and the following routes are defined:

- `/`: Home page (exact route).
- `/login`: Login screen.
- `/register`: Registration screen.
- `/profile`: User profile screen.
- `/shipping`: Shipping information screen.
- `/placeorder`: Place order screen.
- `/order/:id`: Individual order details screen.
- `/payment`: Payment screen.
- `/product/:id`: Individual product details screen.
- `/cart/:id?`: Shopping cart screen.

For admin functionality:

- `/admin/userlist`: User list screen for administrators.
- `/admin/user/:id/edit`: User editing screen for administrators.
- `/admin/productlist`: Product list screen for administrators.
- `/admin/product/:id/edit`: Product editing screen for administrators.
- `/admin/orderlist`: Order list screen for administrators.

These React routes handle the frontend navigation and user interactions of the SoloShop project.

## Getting Started
